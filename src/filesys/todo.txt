1. write a function to convert from logical sector to physical sector
2. write a function to grow a file when writting past EOF


inode.c
	inode_close()
		+ needs to be able to deallocate non-sequential blocks
	inode_read()
		+ like inode_close(), has to read non-sequential blocks
	inode_write()
		+ needs to grow file if writes up to EOF and past
		+ needs to grow file if write starts past EOF
		+ growth should be atomic
		+ change 

directory.c
	struct dir
		+ add a semephore?
	dir_create()
		+ add '.' and '..' entries here? or in mkdir?
